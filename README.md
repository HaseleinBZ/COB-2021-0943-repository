## Abstract

Pipelines are an important part in systems for production, transportation and consumption in the oil and gasindustries.  As the main objects of pipeline transport systems, pipes are subject to strict requirements for the quality ofthe manufacturing materials, production technology, coating quality, as well as their geometric and dimensional aspects.In order to provide inspection of pipes at all stages of logistical movement, it is necessary to find a measurement methodthat can quickly measure the inner pipe diameter and geometry in complex environments.  However, it is not practicalto align a rotary axis measurement system (MS) on the longitudinal axis of a cylindrical pipe with good accuracy, andsubsequent measurements will not directly provide geometric errors, as circularity.  So, if there is a small eccentricityin the MS positioning, the inner circle that this instrument aims to measure can be approximated by a geometry calledlimaçon.  This approach results in a linear equation to identify the unknown measurement parameters, making trivialthe  process  of  determining  the  center  and  radius  of  the  measurand.   This  study  presents  the  evaluation  of  an  activemeasurement system called Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with a 360° rotation axis as MS and uses limaçonapproximation to calculate the decentralization of the MS and the circularity error of the measurand.  The experimentalprocedure includes positioning the LiDAR on a plane perpendicular to the axial axis of the measurand and capturingdata in four positions, i.e., one with the MS approximately concentric to the measurand, and the others with offsets.  Inthe sequence,  the calculation of the circularity deviation by limaçon approximation and uncertainty measurement areperformed to evaluate sources of uncertainty, such as resolution and Azimuth angle.  In addition, the effect of severalparameters, such as angular rate, angular speed and number of revolutions are evaluated, and the results are comparedwith those obtained through an articulated 3D measuring arm.  The results indicate that the smallest circularity erroroccurs when the LiDAR is near to the center and the error due to the approximation in limaçon tends to zero when there isno eccentricity. However, the proposed approach is not suitable for large eccentricities. In addition, the lower the angularvelocity of the LiDAR, the greater the measurement error due to a bigger point cloud measured in a single revolution whenat low speed, which results in more surface details.

## 1st Review


| 01 | Review English language, e.g. I did not understand the following sentence: "Below, in Table (3), the first steps of the roundness uncertainty evaluation, where are defined the circularity error, the eccentricity of the experiment, the limaçon error, and the maximum and minimum radius Rmin and Rmax. The data exposed was synthesized, and can be consulted entirely in (Costa et al., 2021)."                                                                               | Comment |

| 02 | It is unclear what are the disadvantages of an iterative approach: calculation time (probably not an issue), stability (should not be a bigger problem either using damped LM, ...?). If there are enough data for a numerical approximation, an iterative approach might even be more stable than direct calculation due to computer numerical accuracy.                                                                                                                           | Comment |
| 03 | Does a LiDAR necessarily have to use an IR laser, or might it also use visible wavelengths?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Comment |
| 04 | Remove blue background of figure 2, since printed in gray scales reduces visibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Comment |
| 05 | The dimensions of the measured tube are unclear, as well as the location of the sensor within the tube for the different measurement. Maybe a drawing would be helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Comment |
| 06 | Regarding the properties of the measurement system shown in table 2 and the results presented in table 3, I remain in doubt whether the minimum measurement distance was respected. In table 2 the minimum distance is given as 0.2 m --> 200 mm and, according to table 3, the tube radius should be between 202 mm and 225 mm. In combination with an eccentricity of roughly 85 mm, it seems that the minimum distance was violated. Please check values and perform correction. | Comment |
| 07 | The simulated experiment shown in figure 6a is never explained or referenced, ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Comment |
| 08 | Quality of figure 8 is poor, text is too small, lines are too thin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Comment |
| 09 | Text in figures 9 and 11 is pretty small, poor quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Comment |
| 10 | Why does the X-axis of figures 9 b and 10 start at -20, compromising the readability?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Comment |
| 11 | Tables 1, 3, 4 and 5 should be revised, as they are unclear. What are the parameters u and v? The unit mm applies to which columns below, the two last ones ore only the last one? The number of decimal places should be unified, values in the low nm range seem somewhat meaningless. Systematic Effects, Aleatory (probably better random) Effects?                                                                                                                             | Comment |
| 12 | What are the model, resolution and measurement uncertainty of the CMM (Faro arm)? Add a link to the manufacturer's website and data sheet if possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Comment |

| 14 | For the measurements, how was it ensured that the measurement system is perpendicular to the cylinder? What would be the introduced error of a non-perpendicular measurement within the estimated range of deviation of the perpendicularity?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Comment |

| 16 | Why is the LiDAR system characterized as "naturally noisy"? This observation is based on what?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Comment |
| 17 | The reference system has to have a 10x better resolution (or uncertainty?) based on which criteria, this is a rule of thumb. Is there no better explanation?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Comment |
| 18 | The acceptability of the system cannot be based only on the quality of the reference system used to verify it. In case the system does not offer a sufficient discrimination (resolution). Regarding figure 8 it seems the LiDAR simply floats between two values, and its depth resolution is low.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Comment |
| 19 | The curve in Figure 9b results from which experiment or simulation? In the text mentions something about a hypothesis: Does it refer to some sort of statistical evaluation?

| 20 | It does not seem to make much sense that using more input data for the fit results in a higher circularity error. Normally an opposite behavior would be expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Comment |
| 21 | The following sentence is confusing, and should be clarified: "The circularity error was substantially small in CMM measurements, naturally because of its resolution, exactly what was expected due to its function on the experiment as a reference for RPLiDAR measurements"?                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Comment |
| 22 | The whole text is fragmentary and unclear, often presenting different, unrelated facts in subsequent phrases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Comment |
| 23 | Unless the authors do not present a very significant improvement in clearness of the presentation of the results and the written text, the publication should be rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Comment |
