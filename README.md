## Abstract

Pipelines are an important part in systems for production, transportation and consumption in the oil and gasindustries.  As the main objects of pipeline transport systems, pipes are subject to strict requirements for the quality ofthe manufacturing materials, production technology, coating quality, as well as their geometric and dimensional aspects.In order to provide inspection of pipes at all stages of logistical movement, it is necessary to find a measurement methodthat can quickly measure the inner pipe diameter and geometry in complex environments.  However, it is not practicalto align a rotary axis measurement system (MS) on the longitudinal axis of a cylindrical pipe with good accuracy, andsubsequent measurements will not directly provide geometric errors, as circularity.  So, if there is a small eccentricityin the MS positioning, the inner circle that this instrument aims to measure can be approximated by a geometry calledlimaçon.  This approach results in a linear equation to identify the unknown measurement parameters, making trivialthe  process  of  determining  the  center  and  radius  of  the  measurand.   This  study  presents  the  evaluation  of  an  activemeasurement system called Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with a 360° rotation axis as MS and uses limaçonapproximation to calculate the decentralization of the MS and the circularity error of the measurand.  The experimentalprocedure includes positioning the LiDAR on a plane perpendicular to the axial axis of the measurand and capturingdata in four positions, i.e., one with the MS approximately concentric to the measurand, and the others with offsets.  Inthe sequence,  the calculation of the circularity deviation by limaçon approximation and uncertainty measurement areperformed to evaluate sources of uncertainty, such as resolution and Azimuth angle.  In addition, the effect of severalparameters, such as angular rate, angular speed and number of revolutions are evaluated, and the results are comparedwith those obtained through an articulated 3D measuring arm.  The results indicate that the smallest circularity erroroccurs when the LiDAR is near to the center and the error due to the approximation in limaçon tends to zero when there isno eccentricity. However, the proposed approach is not suitable for large eccentricities. In addition, the lower the angularvelocity of the LiDAR, the greater the measurement error due to a bigger point cloud measured in a single revolution whenat low speed, which results in more surface details.
